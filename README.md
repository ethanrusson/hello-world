Just another repository

My name is Ethan Russon and I’m from Idaho Falls, Idaho. I love this city, even amidst the cold and snow that living in Idaho entails. I’m 22 years-old, and I work as a graphic designer for a marketing studio. I have experience working with websites, but I’m very excited to get a better foundation in HTML and CSS. I thoroughly enjoyed learning JavaScript last semester, and I can’t wait to learn more. I’m pursuing a degree in Web Design & Development.
In current news, I’m about to become a dad! My wife will be giving birth to our first son in just a couple of weeks.
